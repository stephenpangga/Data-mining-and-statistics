If you click on 'Two variables - unpaired' and then 'Nominal vs. Nominal', you get to a page with on the left-hand side a menu with the steps we discussed here. In each of those chapters an explanation is given and YouTube videos are shown (by clicking on the 'Click here to see...') for various software programs, including Python."
